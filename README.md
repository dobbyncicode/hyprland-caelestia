# Purpose
This repo is for me to store my personal modifications on top of the defaults of [caelestia](https://github.com/caelestia-dots/caelestia) dots.

The modification includes
- custom fish greeting
- custom keybindings
- custom hyprland configs
- custom wallpaper fill mode

This `md` will be modified in the future to detail all the modifications, mainly for me to not be confused with what I'm doing.
